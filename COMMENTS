Hi there,

Thanks for looking over my code challenge. I completed the 'fetch' and 'hhbuilder' challenges.

There are no installation instructions necessary for these two challenges, aside from `yarn install` and `yarn test` for 'fetch'.

I would really appreciate any feedback you have to offer me on my code quality and readability.

Cheers,
